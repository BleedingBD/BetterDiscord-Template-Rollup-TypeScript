# Template

## Getting started

1. replace all the stuff in `<>` with your own details in the package.json
2. use `npm run format` to format the code
3. use `npm run lint` to lint the code, checking for potential problems
4. use `npm run build` to build the code, the compiled plugin will be placed in the `dist` folder

## Styles

This plugin allows you to import styles from stylesheet files. By default only sass/scss and regular css files are supported. But you can simply install the `less` or `stylus` package to add support for the other big css dialects.
